# OpenChrome MCP topologies

OpenChrome currently supports one safe direct-controller rule:

> Run at most one direct `openchrome serve --auto-launch` process for the same Chrome debug port and user-data directory.

Multiple MCP clients can still run in parallel today. New `openchrome setup` / `openchrome config` output defaults to the auto-elect topology (`openchrome serve --auto-launch --auto-elect --minimal`): one process wins the Chrome/CDP owner lock and publishes broker metadata; surplus same-profile clients proxy through that broker. For explicit shared-profile deployments, run a single broker owner (`openchrome serve --broker --auto-launch`) and point the other clients at it with `--connect-broker`; otherwise give each client its own isolated port and user-data directory.

## After upgrading OpenChrome

A package update only installs new OpenChrome code. It does **not** rewrite the
MCP server entries already registered in Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, or any
other host. Existing direct entries such as `openchrome serve --auto-launch` keep
using that direct topology until you change the host config.

If a new topology is required to avoid duplicate-controller or opaque `-32000`
startup failures:

1. update the package (`npm install -g openchrome-mcp@latest` or your package
   manager equivalent);
2. rerun `openchrome setup --client <host> ...` with the topology recommended by
   that release, or edit the host MCP config manually;
3. restart the MCP host session. Active sessions usually load their MCP tool
   namespace at startup and will not hot-reload a changed config.

For existing host configs, package update alone is not a migration. Rerun
`openchrome setup --client <host>` or edit the host config manually, then
restart the MCP host.

## Auto-elect default

Use this for new Codex, OpenCode, or Claude Code configs unless you have a reason to pin an older topology.

```bash
openchrome config --client codex
openchrome config --client claude
openchrome config --client opencode
```

Generated configs use:

```bash
openchrome serve --auto-launch --auto-elect --minimal
```

For one `(port, userDataDir)`, exactly one process remains the direct Chrome/CDP owner. Surplus sessions attach as broker clients instead of becoming unsafe second direct controllers.

## Legacy single-owner explicit preset

Use this only when exactly one MCP host/session will use the generated config:

```bash
openchrome config --client codex --topology single-owner
```

Generated configs use:

```bash
openchrome serve --auto-launch --no-auto-elect
```

Do not install this same direct config in multiple clients at the same time.

## Isolated per-client profiles

Use a different port and user-data directory for each client:

```bash
openchrome setup --client codex --port 9223 --user-data-dir ~/.openchrome/profiles/codex
openchrome setup --client claude --port 9224 --user-data-dir ~/.openchrome/profiles/claude
openchrome setup --client opencode --port 9225 --user-data-dir ~/.openchrome/profiles/opencode
```

## Shared-profile broker trust model

Broker mode is the only supported way for more than one MCP client to share a
single Chrome user data directory without auto-elect. The broker process is the sole CDP owner for
that `(port, userDataDir)` pair; every other client must use `--connect-broker`
so it forwards stdio JSON-RPC over the broker's HTTP endpoint instead of opening
its own Chrome/CDP connection.

Use shared-profile broker mode only inside a **same-trust-zone**:

- all connected clients are operated by the same human or automation boundary;
- every client is allowed to see browser state that the shared Chrome profile can
  already see, including authenticated sites and open tabs;
- the broker HTTP endpoint remains loopback-only unless protected by an explicit
  bearer token or per-tenant API-key/JWT configuration;
- untrusted or third-party agents use an isolated `--user-data-dir`, separate
  debug port, or a separate broker.

Do not mix trusted and untrusted MCP clients on one shared profile. The lease and
queue diagnostics are structural by design: they may show session, worker, lane,
target, and queue counters, but they must not expose URL, title, cookie,
screenshot, DOM, or extracted page payloads across tenant boundaries.

### Client recipes

**Claude + Codex against one trusted browser**

```bash
# Terminal 1: the single Chrome/CDP owner
openchrome config --client codex --topology broker-owner --port 9222 \
  --user-data-dir ~/.openchrome/shared-profile
openchrome serve --broker --auto-launch --http 3100 --port 9222 \
  --user-data-dir ~/.openchrome/shared-profile

# Terminal 2+: stdio MCP clients. When the broker has an auth token, share it
# via OPENCHROME_AUTH_TOKEN (the proxy auto-discovers the broker's authTokenEnv
# hint and uses that bearer for every forwarded JSON-RPC request).
openchrome config --client claude --topology broker-client --port 9222 \
  --user-data-dir ~/.openchrome/shared-profile
openchrome serve --connect-broker --port 9222 \
  --user-data-dir ~/.openchrome/shared-profile
```

**OMX / local agent swarm**

Run the broker once in a durable pane, then configure each worker/client entry to
use `--connect-broker --port <broker-port> --user-data-dir <broker-profile>`. Do
not let worker panes start direct `openchrome serve --auto-launch` processes
against the same profile.

**CI**

Use one visible persistent-profile broker per machine. CI should point clients
at that broker instead of spawning disposable or secondary browsers.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Duplicate-controller error on startup | A client started direct mode against the shared profile | Stop the direct client and restart it with `--connect-broker`, or migrate that host to an isolated port/profile. If you just upgraded OpenChrome, rerun setup or edit the host config; the package update did not change the existing registration. |
| `No broker metadata found` | Broker owner is not running or profile/port do not match | Start the broker with the same `--port` and `--user-data-dir`. |
| A client lost connection but Chrome stayed open | Expected proxy disconnect behavior | Reconnect the stdio proxy; do not start a second direct owner. |
| Cross-tenant resource denial | The MCP session is bound to a different tenant | Use the matching tenant credentials or an isolated profile. |
| Memory pressure from too many tabs | Shared profile accumulates all clients' tabs | Close unused sessions/tabs or split clients across isolated profiles. |

## Verification

Maintainers can verify the local auto-elect topology without touching user MCP configs or the real Chrome profile:

```bash
npm run build
npm run verify:parallel-auto-elect
```

The script uses a temp Chrome user-data-dir and temp broker registry, starts at least three stdio MCP clients against one `(port, userDataDir)`, and asserts one direct owner plus broker/proxy clients that complete `initialize` and `tools/list`.
