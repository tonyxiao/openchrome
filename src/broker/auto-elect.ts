/**
 * Auto-elect coordinated sharing (#1480; SSOT decision D3 Q1′).
 *
 * Pure, side-effect-free decision helpers for the default `serve --auto-launch`
 * election path:
 *
 *   - the process that WINS the controller lock becomes the broker OWNER and
 *     publishes broker discovery metadata (so surplus sessions can attach);
 *   - a process that LOSES to a healthy owner becomes a coordinated CLIENT
 *     (`--connect-broker` proxy) instead of failing fast.
 *
 * The default applies only to the direct `serve --auto-launch` path. Operators
 * can still opt out (`--no-auto-elect` / `OPENCHROME_AUTO_ELECT=0`) or choose an
 * explicit role (`--broker` / `--connect-broker`), and the unsafe shared attach
 * escape hatch remains separate. Keeping the decisions here (rather than inline
 * in src/index.ts) makes the election rules unit-testable without booting a
 * server or Chrome.
